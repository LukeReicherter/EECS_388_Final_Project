# EECS_388_Final_Project
This project involved designing a simple embedded system that encompasses automatic breaking and automatic steering functionality for a self-driving car. We utilized serial communication, sensors, and actuators that can distinguish between different breaking scenarios. This project can also simulate automatic steering based on video input using a pre-trained Deep Neural Network.

This project was completed in Spring 2025
